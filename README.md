This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Overview
GoalForge is a blockchain-based platform that simplifies access to blockchain technology and reduces transaction costs through the Avalanche network. It empowers users to manage and achieve their goals in a decentralized, community-driven environment.

## Vision Statement
GoalForge aims to provide user-friendly blockchain access, enabling cost-effective transactions and fostering a community-driven approach to goal management.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for managing goals
- Cost-effective transactions via Avalanche
- Community-driven goal management
- Real-time updates and notifications

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd goalforge
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access the application. You can start managing your goals and interacting with the community.

## Workflow
